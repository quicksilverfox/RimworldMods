	<description>A nice happy race of people-foxes. Alien Race Framework required, load after it. Built-in support for EPOE.
	
	Plenty of things planned in the versions to come, this is the first public release so don't expect too much.
	
	Relationships incompatible with Psychology - not my fault, can't fix on my end.
	
	Adds Faction, starting Scenario, playable Race, Throne, Quarterstaff and Bycocket (Robin Hood Hats).
	
	Plenty of backstories, as well as names. Suggestions? Find @MikeRobe on the Rimworld Discord.
